Test results, short overview:

The longest calculation route was tested with the following query: "TreeMap, Consumption view, Total products, Total regions".
On average the task takes 8 seconds. If 16 users do a call simultaneously the last user had to wait approx. 2 minutes.
For 32 users we found similar behaviour, in which the last user had to wait approx. 5 minutes.

*note: this excludes testing for modeling final demand.*

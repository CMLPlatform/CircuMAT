Most metal ores are polymetallic, i.e. the metal ore contains more than one metal. The different metals are separated during the production process.[...] Metals are essential for a wide range of industries like mechanical engineering, transport, aerospace, construction, packaging, electricity and energy, consumer electronics, medical devices, etc.</i>(EUROSTAT) <h5>Domestic Extraction Used - Non-Metallic Minerals (Unit kt)</h5> <i> Minerals are essential raw materials for modern society, contributing significantly to its social and technological progress. They are used for the production of infrastructure such as roads, homes, schools and hospitals, and in many industrial and consumer products such as cars, computers, medicines, and household appliances.</i>(EUROSTAT) <h5>Vulnerable employment (Unit 1000p)</h5><i> Own-account workers and contributing family workers have a likelihood of having [in]formal work arrangements, and are therefore more likely to lack elements associated with decent employment, such as adequate social security and a voice at work. Therefore, the two statuses are summed to create a classification of ‘vulnerable employment’, while wage and salaried workers together with employers constitute ‘non-vulnerable employment’. </i> (ILO)";
